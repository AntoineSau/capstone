						All players initially agree on different <b>"categories"</b> that they want to play with (names, countries, cities, objects, ...).
					</li>
					<br>
					<li>
						They define a <b>duration</b> to play each round, and the total amount of rounds that they want to play.
					</li>
					<br>
					<li>
						They play each round with a specific <b>letter</b>, which chosen randomly by a player or by our website.
					</li>
					<br>
					<li>
						During each round, all the players need to find one word per category. 
						These words need to start with the letter chosen for the round.
					</li>
					<li>
						Each round stops at the end of the timer, or if one of the players found one word for each category before the end.
					</li>
					<br>
					<li>
						At the end of each round, the players count their points as below, for each combination fo word and category:
						<h5>
							<br><br>
							- When players have a unique word, they get 2 points.
							<br><br>
							- When players have a repeated word (played by someone else in the same round), they get 1 point.
							<br><br>
							- When players don't have any word, they don't get any point
						</h5>
					</li>
					<br>
					<li>
						When all rounds are finished, all players sum all their point.
						<br>
						The player with the highest amount of point wins!
